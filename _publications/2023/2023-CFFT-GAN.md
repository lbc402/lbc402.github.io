abstract:       "We propose a more general learning approach by considering two domain features as a whole and learning both inter-domain correspondence and intra-domain potential information interactions. Specifically, we design a Cross-domain Feature Fusion Transformer (CFFT) to learn inter- and intra-domain feature fusion."
