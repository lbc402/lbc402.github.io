abstract:       " Since NeRF renders an image pixel by pixel, it is possible to split NeRF in the spatial dimension. We propose a Compositional Neural Radiance Field (CNeRF) for semantic 3D-aware portrait synthesis and manipulation. CNeRF divides the image by semantic regions and learns an independent neural radiance field for each region, and finally fuses them and renders the complete image"
