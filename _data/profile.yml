  <p>
    I am a Senior Researcher in the Intelligent Creation department at ByteDance, where I have been working since graduating with my Master's degree from Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications (BUPT) in 2020. 
  </p>
  <p>
    My professional journey is deeply 
    rooted in the fascinating field of Generative AI.
     During the era of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), 
     I embarked on pioneering research in visual synthesis and manipulation. 
     As the emergence of Diffusion models has driven the evolution of the technological landscape, 
     I have consistently remained at the forefront of exploring controllable visual generation, striving to achieve unparalleled realism and precision. 
     Currently, I am dedicated to tackling the core challenges in the dynamic domain of AI video generation — a pursuit I firmly believe is a crucial pathway toward the grand vision of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI).
